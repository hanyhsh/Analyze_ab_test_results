# Analyze_ab_test_results
A/B testing for webpage.

_For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision._


## The project consists of the following:
Part I - Probability
Part II - A/B Test
Part III - Regression
Part IV - Conclusions

we will be working with two dataset: Page and Location

__The analysis includes different techniques of calculated and interprting p_values, Z_score, sample simulation, regression, Confidence intervals and other tests.__
